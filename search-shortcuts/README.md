# Search-shortcuts

Search-shortcuts is a Visual Studio Code extension.  
Aiming to add a quick and easy way to add and toggle between predefined file include/exculde rules and patterns to the searches.

User will be able to define search patterns or sets of those in the settings json.  
My target is to provide a comfortable way include these patterns via the workspace files for a project, and to prevent some typing :).

This is a learner project, Im completely new to VSCode Extensions, TypeScript and also to git/github.

* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets
