# Search-shortcuts

Search-shortcuts is a Visual Studio Code extension.  
Aiming to create a quick and easy way to add and toggle between predefined file include/exculde rules and patterns to the searches.

User will be able to define search patterns or sets of those in the settings json.  
My target is to provide a comfortable way to include these patterns via the workspace files for a project, and to prevent some typing :).

This is a learner project, Im completely new to VSCode Extensions, TypeScript and also to git/github.
